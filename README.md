# Seaborn Visualization Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data visualization projects created using Seaborn, a powerful Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. These projects demonstrate various techniques for creating informative and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.

## Contents
The repository includes examples of:
- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE, etc.)
- Categorical plots (bar plots, box plots, violin plots)
- Relational plots (scatter plots, line plots)
- Regression plots
- Matrix plots (heatmaps, cluster maps)
- Multi-plot grids
- Custom styling and themes

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Seaborn for statistical visualizations
- Matplotlib for customizing plots

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)



## Example Visualizations

The repository includes several key visualization types:

1. **Distribution Plots**: Visualizing the distribution of a dataset
2. **Categorical Plots**: Showing the relationship between a numerical and one or more categorical variables
3. **Relational Plots**: Visualizing the relationship between two or more variables
4. **Heatmaps**: Displaying matrix data with color-encoded values
5. **Pair Plots**: Exploring relationships between multiple variables simultaneously
